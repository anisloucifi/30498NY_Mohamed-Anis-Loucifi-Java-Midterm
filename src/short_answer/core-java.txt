Explain the entire java life cycle.
Answer:
in Java application development, the Java development life cycle comprises the following phases:

Planning  : project owners and project managers collaborate to define the timeline of the project,
come up with cost estimates, and determine the resources required for the project.

Requirements Gathering : The second phase of the Java development process is requirements gathering.

Design : this phase, the team works together to create a high-level design for the application.
This design will guide the implementation process and help ensure that all necessary functionality is included in the final product.
Implementation :n this phase, the team works together to turn the design into a working code. This involves writing classes, methods, and tests.

Testing : the team works together to test the application to ensure it meets all requirements.
This includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.

Deployment :In this phase, the team collaborates to deploy the application to a production environment.
 This includes setting up servers, configuring networking, and more.
What is a class?
Answer:
all java code are defined in a Class it has variables and methods

 The name of the constructor must be similar to the class name and must have an explicit return type.

Explain the process of Java garbage collection?
Answer:
In Java, garbage collection is the process of managing memory, automatically. It finds the unused objects (that are no longer used by the program) and delete or remove them to free up the memory.
The garbage collection mechanism uses several GC algorithms. The most popular algorithm that is used is Mark and Sweep.
